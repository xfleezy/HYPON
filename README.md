# HYPON
Pytorch implementation for HYPON: Embedding Biomedical Ontology using Hyperbolic Ontology Neural network.

## Abstract
Constructing high-quality biomedical ontologies is one of the first  steps  to  study  new  concepts,  such  as  emerging  infectious diseases. Manually curated ontologies are often noisy, especially  for  new  knowledge  that  requires  domain  expertise. In this paper, we proposed a novel ontology embedding approach  HYPON  to  automate  this  process.  In  contrast  to conventional  approaches,  we  propose  to  embed  biomedical ontology in the hyperbolic space to better model the hierarchical structure. Importantly, our method is able to consider both  graph  structure  and  the  varied-size  set  of  concept  instances, which are largely overlooked by existing methods. We demonstrated substantial improvement in comparison to thirteen comparison approaches on eleven biomedical ontologies, including two recently curated COVID-19 ontologies.
